# Fullscreen-Toggle-Mod-for-Shapez.io
This mod enables toggling fullscreen mode in Shapez.io using the F11 key (or a configurable key). It properly intercepts the key event and uses the game's native API to switch fullscreen mode. Compatible with Steam, web, and standalone Electron versions of the game.
